# Reusable Behaviors

_Behaviors are reusable across more than one application. These articles explain how to create useful behaviors to perform commonly used functionality._

## [Reusable EffectBehavior](effect-behavior.md)

Behaviors are a useful approach for adding an effect to a control, removing boiler-plate effect handling code from code-behind files. This article demonstrates creating and consuming a Xamarin.Forms behavior to add an effect to a control.

## [Reusable EventToCommandBehavior](event-to-command-behavior.md)

Behaviors can be used to associate commands with controls that were not designed to interact with commands. This article demonstrates creating and consuming a Xamarin.Forms behavior to invoke a command when an event fires.
