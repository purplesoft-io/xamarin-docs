# Xamarin.Forms gestures

_Gesture recognizers can be used to detect user interaction with views in a Xamarin.Forms application._

The Xamarin.Forms [`GestureRecognizer`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.GestureRecognizer) class supports tap, pinch, pan, and swipe gestures on [`View`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.View) instances.

## [Adding a tap gesture recognizer](tap.md)

A tap gesture is used for tap detection and is recognized with the [`TapGestureRecognizer`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.TapGestureRecognizer) class.

## [Adding a pinch gesture recognizer](pinch.md)

A pinch gesture is used for performing interactive zoom and is recognized with the [`PinchGestureRecognizer`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.PinchGestureRecognizer) class.

## [Adding a pan gesture recognizer](pan.md)

A pan gesture is used for detecting the movement of fingers around the screen and applying that movement to content, and is recognized with the [`PanGestureRecognizer`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.PanGestureRecognizer) class.

## [Adding a swipe gesture recognizer](swipe.md)

A swipe gesture occurs when a finger is moved across the screen in a horizontal or vertical direction, and is often used to initiate navigation through content. Swipe gestures are recognized with the [`SwipeGestureRecognizer`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.SwipeGestureRecognizer) class.
