# Summary of Chapter 10. XAML markup extensions

[![Download Sample](~/media/shared/download.png) Download the sample](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter10)

Normally, the XAML parser converts any string set as an attribute value to the type of the property based on standard conversions for the basic .NET data types, or a [`TypeConverter`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.TypeConverter) derivative attached to the property or its type with a [`TypeConverterAttribute`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.TypeConverterAttribute).

But it's sometimes convenient to set an attribute from a different source, for example, an item in a dictionary, or the value of a static property or field, or from a calculation of some sort.

This is the job of a *XAML markup extension*. Despite the name, XAML markup extensions are *not* an extension to XML. XAML is always legal XML.

## The code infrastructure

A XAML markup extension is a class that implements the [`IMarkupExtension`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.IMarkupExtension) interface. Such a class often has the word `Extension` at the end of its name but usually appears in XAML without that suffix.

The following XAML markup extensions are supported by all implementations of XAML:

- `x:Static` supported by [`StaticExtension`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.StaticExtension)
- `x:Reference` supported by [`ReferenceExtension`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.ReferenceExtension)
- `x:Type` supported by [`TypeExtension`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.TypeExtension)
- `x:Null` supported by [`NullExtension`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.NullExtension)
- `x:Array` supported by [`ArrayExtension`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.ArrayExtension)

These four XAML markup extensions are supported by many implementations of XAML, including Xamarin.Forms:

- `StaticResource` supported by [`StaticResourceExtension`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.StaticResourceExtension)
- `DynamicResource` supported by [`DynamicResourceExtension`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.DynamicResourceExtension)
- `Binding` supported by [`BindingExtension`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.BindingExtension)&mdash;discussed in [Chapter 16. Data binding](#chapter16)
- `TemplateBinding` supported by [`TemplateBindingExtension`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.TemplateBindingExtension)&mdash;not covered in the book

An additional XAML markup extension is included in Xamarin.Forms in connection with [`RelativeLayout`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.RelativeLayout):

- [`ConstraintExpression`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.ConstraintExpression)&mdash;not covered in the book

## Accessing static members

Use the [`x:Static`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.StaticExtension) element to set an attribute to the value of a public static property, field, or enumeration member. Set the [`Member`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.StaticExtension.Member) property to the static member. It's usually easier to specify `x:Static` and the member name in curly braces. The name of the `Member` property does not need to be included, just the member itself. This common syntax is shown in the [**SharedStatics**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter10/SharedStatics) sample. The static fields themselves are defined in the [`AppConstants`](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/blob/master/Chapter10/SharedStatics/SharedStatics/SharedStatics/AppConstants.cs) class. This technique allows you to establish constants used through a program.

With an additional XML namespace declaration, you can reference public static properties, fields, or enumeration members defined in the .NET framework, as demonstrated in the [**SystemStatics**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter10/SystemStatics) sample.

## Resource dictionaries

The `VisualElement` class defines a property named [`Resources`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.VisualElement.Resources) that you can set to an object of type [`ResourceDictionary`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.ResourceDictionary). Within XAML, you can store items in this dictionary and identify them with the `x:Key` attribute. The items stored in the resource dictionary are shared among all references to the item.

### StaticResource for most purposes

In most cases you'll use the [`StaticResource`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.StaticResourceExtension) markup extension to reference an item from the resource dictionary, as demonstrated by the [**ResourceSharing**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter10/ResourceSharing) sample. You can use a `StaticResourceExtension` element or `StaticResource` within curly braces:

Do not confuse the `x:Static` markup extension and the `StaticResource` markup extension.

### A tree of dictionaries

When the XAML parser encounters a `StaticResource`, it begins searching up the visual tree for a matching key, and then looks in the `ResourceDictionary` in the application's `App` class. This allows items in a resource dictionary deeper in the visual tree to override a resource dictionary higher in the visual tree. This is demonstrated in the [**ResourceTrees**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter10/ResourceTrees) sample.

### DynamicResource for special purposes

The `StaticResource` markup extension causes an item to be retrieved from the dictionary when a visual tree is built during the `InitializeComponent` call. An alternative to `StaticResource` is [`DynamicResource`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.DynamicResourceExtension), which maintains a link to the dictionary key and updates the target when the item referenced by the key changes.

The difference between `StaticResource` and `DynamicResource` is demonstrated in the [**DynamicVsStatic**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter10/DynamicVsStatic) sample.

A property set by `DynamicResource` must be backed by a bindable property as discussed in [Chapter 11, The bindable infrastructure](chapter11.md).

## Lesser-used markup extensions

Use the [`x:Null`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.NullExtension) markup extension to set a property to `null`.

Use the [`x:Type`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.TypeExtension) markup extension to set a property to a .NET `Type` object.

Use [`x:Array`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.ArrayExtension) to define an array. Specify the type of the array members by setting the [`Type`] property to an `x:Type` markup extension.

## A custom markup extension

You can create your own XAML markup extensions by writing a class that implements the [`IMarkupExtension`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.IMarkupExtension) interface with a [`ProvideValue`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.Xaml.IMarkupExtension.ProvideValue(System.IServiceProvider)) method.

The [`HslColorExtension`](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/blob/master/Libraries/Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit/Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit/HslColorExtension.cs) class satisfies those requirement. It creates a value of type `Color` based on values of properties named `H`, `S`, `L`, and `A`. This class is the first item in a Xamarin.Forms library named [**Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Libraries/Xamarin.FormsBook.Toolkit) that is built up and used over the course of this book.

The [**CustomExtensionDemo**](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-book-samples/tree/master/Chapter10/CustomExtensionDemo) sample demonstrates how to reference this library and use the custom markup extension.
