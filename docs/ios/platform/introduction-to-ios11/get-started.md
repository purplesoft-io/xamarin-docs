# Getting Started with iOS 11

_Download and install Xcode 9_

> [!NOTE]
> iOS 11, tvOS 11, and watchOS 4 require Xcode 9.
>
> Visual Studio for Mac is also required - you cannot use Xcode 9 with Xamarin Studio.

## Download and Install

Follow these steps to ensure you're ready to work with the latest iOS, tvOS, and watchOS features:

1. **Install the latest Xcode** – [Download](https://developer.apple.com/download/) and install the latest version of _Xcode 9_.

2. **Run Xcode First** – Run Xcode once, before updating and running Visual Studio for Mac, as it installs some tools that Xamarin requires the first time it is run.

3. **Update to the latest Stable release** – Follow the instructions on the [Xcode 9 release blog](https://releases.xamarin.com/stable-release-15-3-5-with-xcode-9-support/).

4. _(optional)_ **Install the latest iOS Beta for real Apple Hardware** – To test iOS 11 on any physical iOS devices, [download](https://developer.apple.com/download/) and install the iOS beta on your devices.


### Visual Studio 2017 on Windows

After installing Xcode 9 on your Mac, follow the links on the [Xcode 9 release blog](https://releases.xamarin.com/stable-release-15-3-5-with-xcode-9-support/) for installing the **Xamarin.VS 4.7** extension for Visual Studio 2017 on Windows.
